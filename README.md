# Data-Analysis-Project
This project analyzes how student habits — such as sleep hours, Netflix time, and study routines — correlate with exam scores. Using Python with pandas for data handling and matplotlib/seaborn for visualization, I explored patterns and highlighted how lifestyle choices may impact academic performance.
